            <h4>A humble beginning
                <hr class="subheading" />
            </h4>

            <p>Josep “Pep” Guardiola Sala was born in Santpedor,
                Spain on January 18th, 1971 to father Valentí Guardiola,
                a retired brick layer and mother Dolors Sala Guardiola, a
                sales person. Thou he wasn’t both into riches as some of
                his contemporaries. It was football that consumed him
                from the early onset.
                Already from an early age, Guardiola formed the daily
                habit of leaving home to kicking football for hours on
                a square-like football field next to his father’s house.

            <h4>Nou Camp Ballboy Master
                <hr class="subheading" />
            </h4>

            <p>Pep Guardiola began his path to football greatness as a Nou Camp ballboy master.
                He was part of Barca’s youth structure when Venables arrived as manager back in 1984,
                and had already shown signs of developing his knowledge of the game.
                Friends from his childhood have revealed that even at such a young age, Guardiola was
                developing the single-mindedness and drive that has turned him into the world’s most
                famous football manager. This was a year after he started his football career at the
                Barcelona youth academy.

            <h4>A Winning Mentality
                <hr class="subheading" />
            </h4>

            <p>After a successful spell at the Club as a player and as coach of Barça B, Guardiola won 14 of a possible
                19 trophies in four seasons in charge of the first team
                Josep Guardiola, one of the most important players in Barcelona’s history, took over as first team
                manager on 17 June 2008 after a brilliant season as coach of Barça Atlètic with whom he won promotion to
                Second Division B.
                <br />
                <br />
                <quote><strong><em>“I can’t promise you silverware, but I can say that we’ll keep on battling to the end
                            and you’ll be proud of us,”</em></strong></quote> - he said on the day of his first Gamper
                Trophy. And he was right.


                <br />

                <p />
            <p>The fifteenth Catalan manager in the history of the club arrived with the mission to end a two-season
                long trophy drought. To do that he used the same 4-3-3 system he had experienced as a Barça player and
                which had brought him success at Barça Atlètic.
            </p>
            <P>Pep Guardiola and assistant coach Tito Vilanova's team only understood one way of playing football which
                is to attack, keep possession and move the ball around so that the other team has to run after it.
                That’s the way his Barça side played, as did his Barça Atlètic, and they had more possession and more
                shots on goal than virtually every team they played. He appreciated the talent of his players but he put
                hard work and individual sacrifice for the common cause first. He saw football as a team sport in which
                he has ultimate responsibility for results and was therefore also the leader of the squad.
            </p>

            <h4>Detail-oriented and Meticulous
                <hr class="subheading" />
            </h4>
            <p>
                Josep Guardiola was a meticulous manager who saw to the tiniest of details. He got ready for every game
                with videos of the opposition and never thinks beyond the next match. He was a brilliant motivator who
                brought the best out of each player in his squad. This philosophy of football led to his success as
                first team boss, when the team had their best year in the history of the Club winning the Spanish League
                and Copa double, the Champions League, both the European and Spanish Super Cups and the Club World Cup
                in the year of the six titles.
            </P>

            <h4>Success: Reward for Hardwork</h4>
            <hr class="subheading" />
            </h4>
            <p>
                This excellent campaign means that Guardiola was the third manager after Cruyff and Samitier to pick up
                the league title as coach after having won it as a player at Barça. He became the sixth man to win the
                Champions League as a manager having previously done so as a player, and the first manager to win the
                treble in the 21st century and the first ever to win six titles in a single year.

                In the 2009/10 season, Guardiola’s second in charge, the Liga title was won for the second year in a
                row, and the twentieth on club history, setting a new record of 99 points in the process. The title was
                not decided until the very last day, with a 4-0 win against Valladolid at Camp Nou, Barça claiming the
                league title at home for the first time in front of their own fans since 1993/94.

            <p>
                The avalanche of titles did not stop there. In 2010/11 the team won the Spanish Super Cup, the league
                and the Champions League. The following campaign they won the Spanish Super Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the
                Club World Cup and the Copa del Rey. In the final of the latter, the last game with Guardiola in charge,
                the team produced an opening half hour in the 3-0 win over Athletic Club that many consider to be
                amongst the finest passages of football played by Pep’s Barça side.

                During Guardiola’s time, Barça did not just triumph, they collected records and trophies like other
                collect stamps. In those four years they broke more than 40 national, European and World footballing
                records and won 14 out of a possible 19 trophies, an unprecedented achievement in footballing history.
